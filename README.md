# Pattern-Printing-in-C-language
==== C-language (Pattern-Printing) =====

The C programming language allows us to print a variety of patterns, including Floyd's triangle, Pascal's triangle, odd number triangles, star patterns, star cross patterns, alphabet patterns, hollow patterns, and more.

**How to approach patterns?**
1) Number of rows = Number of lines
2) How many times will the outer loop run?
3) Identify for every Row no.
4) How many number of columns?
5) Find column's element type.
6) What should you print?
7) Establish the row-to-column relationship.
   
**IMPORTANT**
  1) Always Dry Run your code by using pen paper in your initial stage of learning.
  2) When you are running in compiler/editor, do some small changes Like - variables values / printing variables / conditions to analize the changes in output.
  3) Try with some other method / put some other condition to achieve same output.
